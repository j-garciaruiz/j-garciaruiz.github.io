Colombia's journey toward universal health coverage offers valuable lessons for other countries pursuing similar goals. After three decades of reforms, the country has moved from explicit health benefits packages to an implicit model that promises coverage for "everything for everyone."

## The Evolution

In the early 1990s, Colombia introduced two explicit health benefits packages: one for the contributory regime (formal sector workers) and another for the subsidized regime (informal workers and the poor). This dual system created significant inequities, as the contributory package was far more comprehensive than its subsidized counterpart.

By 2012, the country had unified these packages, attempting to reduce disparities. However, the explicit package approach faced persistent challenges: rapid medical technology advancement, high administrative costs of updating the package, and continued legal challenges through the constitutional court system.

## The 2015 Reform

The landmark 2015 health reform Law 1751 transformed Colombia's approach by establishing an implicit benefits package. This law guaranteed access to all health services not explicitly excluded, effectively inverting the previous logic. Now, instead of defining what is covered, the system defines a small list of exclusions.

## Key Lessons for Other LMICs

**1. Political Economy Matters**

The shift from explicit to implicit coverage was as much a political decision as a technical one. Years of constitutional court litigation demonstrated that citizens would not accept being denied medically necessary services simply because they weren't on an explicit list.

**2. Fiscal Sustainability Requires Strong Governance**

While an implicit package expands coverage, it also requires robust priority-setting mechanisms to ensure fiscal sustainability. Colombia has struggled with this balance, leading to ongoing debates about the system's financial viability.

**3. Equity Should Be Central**

The dual package system's failure demonstrates that separate-but-equal approaches rarely work in health systems. Universal coverage requires genuinely universal access, not tiered systems that perpetuate inequality.

**4. Implementation Gaps Persist**

Despite formal coverage guarantees, Colombia still faces significant gaps between de jure rights and de facto access. Geographic barriers, administrative hurdles, and supply-side constraints limit the practical impact of coverage expansions.

## Looking Forward

Colombia's experience shows that expanding health benefits is not simply a matter of listing covered services. It requires:

- Strong health system infrastructure
- Adequate financing mechanisms
- Effective governance and regulation
- Commitment to equity as a core principle
- Mechanisms to address implementation gaps

For countries considering similar reforms, Colombia's three-decade experiment offers both inspiration and cautionary tales. The path to universal health coverage is neither quick nor straightforward, but the lessons learned can help others navigate their own journeys more effectively.

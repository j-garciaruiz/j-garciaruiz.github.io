The COVID-19 pandemic exposed deep structural inequities in vaccine access across Latin America. While wealthy nations secured vaccines through advance purchase agreements, many Latin American countries struggled to access doses, leading to delayed rollouts and preventable deaths. Research conducted with Oxfam International reveals several critical insights about what went wrong—and what we must do differently next time.

## The Numbers Tell a Stark Story

By mid-2021, when vaccination rates in high-income countries exceeded 40%, many Latin American nations had vaccinated less than 5% of their populations. This disparity wasn't accidental; it was the predictable outcome of a global system that prioritized purchasing power over public health need.

## Why Vaccine Nationalism Prevailed

Several factors contributed to Latin America's vaccine access challenges:

### 1. Advance Purchase Agreements Favored Wealthy Nations

High-income countries used their purchasing power to secure doses far beyond their population needs. Some countries purchased enough vaccines to immunize their populations multiple times over, while low- and middle-income countries struggled to secure any doses.

### 2. Intellectual Property Barriers

Patent protections and limited technology transfer slowed the development of regional manufacturing capacity. Despite having capable pharmaceutical industries, Latin American countries couldn't produce mRNA vaccines due to intellectual property constraints and lack of technology sharing.

### 3. COVAX Fell Short

While the COVAX initiative aimed to ensure equitable access, it faced chronic underfunding and supply shortages. By the time COVAX doses reached Latin America, wealthier nations had already vaccinated their priority populations.

### 4. Bilateral Negotiations Disadvantaged Smaller Countries

Vaccine manufacturers prioritized negotiations with larger, wealthier countries. Smaller Latin American nations found themselves at the back of the queue, with limited negotiating power.

## Country-Level Variations

Even within Latin America, significant disparities emerged:

- **Chile** secured early access through aggressive bilateral negotiations and diverse portfolio approach
- **Uruguay** benefited from strong diplomatic relationships and regional coordination
- **Countries in Central America** faced severe delays, depending primarily on COVAX donations
- **Brazil** developed domestic vaccine production but faced political obstacles in procurement

## The Human Cost

These delays had devastating consequences. Each month of delayed vaccination meant:

- Thousands of preventable deaths
- Prolonged economic disruption
- Increased risk of new variant emergence
- Deepened social and economic inequalities

## Lessons for Future Pandemics

### Strengthen Regional Manufacturing

Latin America needs investment in vaccine manufacturing capacity with guaranteed technology transfer agreements. The region has the scientific capability but lacks the infrastructure and intellectual property access.

### Reform the International System

The pandemic demonstrated that voluntary mechanisms for vaccine sharing are insufficient. We need binding international agreements that prioritize public health over pharmaceutical profits.

### Build Strategic Stockpiles

Countries should maintain regional vaccine stockpiles and production capacity, rather than relying entirely on just-in-time global supply chains.

### Invest in Primary Health Care

Strong primary health care systems enabled some countries to rapidly deploy vaccines once doses became available. This infrastructure requires sustained investment.

### Address Vaccine Hesitancy

Supply-side solutions alone aren't enough. Many countries faced vaccine hesitancy driven by misinformation, lack of trust in government, and legitimate concerns about vaccine safety. Building trust requires transparent communication and community engagement.

## Moving Forward

The COVID-19 pandemic won't be our last global health emergency. Climate change, antimicrobial resistance, and emerging infectious diseases ensure that future crises will test our global health systems again.

The question is: Will we learn from the vaccine equity failures of COVID-19, or will we repeat the same mistakes?

Latin America's experience offers a clear warning: a global health system that allows wealthy nations to monopolize life-saving medical technologies is not just inequitable—it's ineffective. Variants that emerge in undervaccinated populations don't respect borders. Global health security requires genuine equity, not charity.

The path forward requires political will, sustained investment, and a commitment to treating health as a human right rather than a commodity. The next pandemic will test whether we've learned these lessons.
